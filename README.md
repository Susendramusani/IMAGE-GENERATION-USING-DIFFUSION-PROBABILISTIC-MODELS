# Introduction:
This research explores image processing techniques and neural network models for item recognition. It involves image preprocessing, autoencoder-based feature extraction, and the use of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and similarity searches.
# Methodology:
▪ Image Preprocessing: Images are loaded, resized to 32x32 pixels, and normalized. Two datasets are created for training and testing.

▪ Autoencoder-based Feature Extraction: An autoencoder is built using TensorFlow Keras, featuring convolutional and up sampling layers. It is trained to create a compact representation of images.

▪ Image Similarity Search: After training, the encoder generates encoded representations of test images. Cosine similarity is computed between a selected image and others to identify the most similar images.

▪ Pre-trained CNN for Feature Extraction: The InceptionV3 model is used to extract features, which are then used to calculate cosine similarity and identify similar images.

# Results:
The autoencoder successfully learns a compressed representation, capturing essential image information despite some loss.
Similar images are accurately identified using cosine similarity based on the autoencoder's encoded representations.
The InceptionV3 model also performs well in feature extraction, demonstrating effective transfer learning for image recognition.

# Conclusion:
The methodologies showcase effective image preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity search in object recognition. The autoencoder offers a lightweight feature extraction solution, while pre-trained CNNs provide high performance with minimal customization. Future optimizations could enhance these methods for real-world applications.
# Recommendations:
Experiment with different autoencoder architectures and hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
Test alternative pre-trained CNN models and fine-tuning approaches for better performance.
Assess the algorithms on larger datasets and diverse object categories to evaluate generalization capabilities.
